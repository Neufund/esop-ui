# Neufund Employee Stock Options Plan UI
ESOP-ui is frontend application that allows you to view and manipulate [Neufund ESOP smart contract](https://github.com/Neufund/ESOP).  
  
This README is meant to provide technical information how to run and connect UI to existing smartcontract. For
introduction and information what ESOP is visit [https://github.com/Neufund/ESOP](https://github.com/Neufund/ESOP) where
you will find exhaustive information. 

## Prerequisites
There are following prerequisites to compile, run and use this application:
  * [Neufund ESOP smart contract](https://github.com/Neufund/ESOP)  
  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (we didn't test it on Windows)
  * web browser Chrome, Opera, Firefox with [U2F extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/u2f-support-add-on/)
  * Ethereum wallet / signer [Ledger Nano S](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/ledger-nano-s), [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)
or [Parity Ethereum Integration](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/parity-ethereum-integrati/himekenlppkgeaoeddcliojfddemadig?)

## How to run
At this moment ESOP-ui project depends on compiled contracts that you will find in ESOP repository. We use relative path 
in configuration so clone both repositories into same directory so you have following project structure
    
    .
    |-- ESOP
    |-- ESOP-ui

<sup>you can have different structure -> see config.js file ```truffleArtifacts``` key </sup>

commands to clone both repos:

    git clone git@github.com:Neufund/ESOP.git
    git clone git@github.com:Neufund/ESOP-ui.git
    
edit ```./ESOP-ui/src/config.js``` and set ```ethEndpoint``` to any of public Ethereum endpoints. Our demo contracts are 
deployed to Ethereum testnet, so you have to use testnet endpoint data ex. ```https://api.myetherapi.com/rop```. 
    
switch into ESOP-ui directory, download dependencies and run webpack in development mode.

    cd ESOP-ui
    npm i  
    npm run dev

This will fire local development webserver that will compile and display DAPP connected to Neufund ESOP demo contract.    

## Configuration
Configuration is defined through ```./src/config.js```. Most important parameters are: 
   
* ```truffleArtifacts``` key store absolute or relative path to directory where truffle artifacts are located.
Those are used by [truffle-contract](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle-contract) library which is wrapper to
standard [web3 library](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API). You need to provide them for every
deployment of UI.   
* ```ethEndpoint``` url of Ethereum node. Dapps (abbr decentralized application) are not using typical backend
which provides API. Instead you can connect to any (all are sharing same network) eth node that provides json
RPC api. You can use existing public ones ex. [Infura](https://infura.io/) or you can host your own (that can be a bit
tricky).  
* ```pdfRenderServer``` is endpoint where instance of [PDF render server](https://github.com/Neufund/document-rendering-server) is deployed.
 It is service that will generate pdf's with employee data similar to html view in "Show agreement" popup. If you leave this option empty this functionality will stay off.  
* You can define your own ```derivationPath```. If none (or empty string) is provided dapp will use default from [ledger-wallet-provider](https://github.com/Neufund/ledger-wallet-provider) project.  

## Build
Issue ```npm run build``` command and Webpack will compile build into ```./ESOP-ui/build``` directory. 

## Deployment
Put contents of ```./ESOP-ui/build``` directory on any https capable webserver. Github pages etc. are also good.

## Implementation details
Project is not very complicated. We use standard standard JS frameworks [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/),
[Redux](http://redux.js.org/) and [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
as module bundler. To communicate with Ethereum network we use [truffle-contract](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle-contract)
library. Still there are few interesting points worth mentioning:

### Ledger Nano S / web3 injection
We decided to allow your users to use [Ledger Nano S](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/ledger-nano-s) which is cool
security device. Since its hardware it introduces some complications into usage flow and code.
We managed to resolve most of problems by creating neat library which expose standard web3 object that underneath
communicate with device and use it to sign transactions. After experiences we got with this project we will improve
it a bit, but it's already pretty interesting - [ledger-wallet-provider](https://github.com/Neufund/ledger-wallet-provider).

But now we ended with need to dynamically choose which web3 we gonna use: one provided by browser (Metamask / Parity) or one
with Nano support. We do it in typical way proposed by web3 doc:  

    if (typeof window.web3 !== 'undefined') {
        //"web3 already exists" it means Metamask / Parity are beeing used.
    } else {
        // use own web3 that can use Nano
        let engine = new ProviderEngine();
        let ledgerWalletSubProvider = await LedgerWalletSubproviderFactory();
        engine.addProvider(ledgerWalletSubProvider);
        ...
        window.web3 = new Web3(engine);
    }

### transaction confirmation
One thing that was unpleasant surprise is way that truffle-contract handles sending transactions to eth network.
Returned Promise is resolved not when transaction is mined but when transaction is accepted by node. Because of that you 
still need to manually check when transaction is visible on network. Also it turns out some public nodes like Infura are
not supportingÂ web3 [web3.eth.filter](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3ethfilter). We had to
introduce where we pool network every second to check if transaction is mined.

### truffle artifacts
In ESOP project we rely on truffle framework to compile and deploy smart contracts. In UI project we use truffle-contract 
which works really nice when you are using contracts deployed with truffle. Point of contact between those two are artifact
files created  during compilation and updated after deployment. Those contain abi definitions, compiled byte code and
contract addresses in every network (local, test, main) you deployed contracts to. At this moment we store those files
in ESOP repo. Then in UI code that uses truffle-contract looks like this:  

    import RoTDef from 'truffle-artifacts/RoT.json'
    ...
    this.RoTContractAbstr = contractBuilder(RoTDef);
    this.RoTContractAbstr.setProvider(web3.currentProvider);
    this.RoTContract = this.RoTContractAbstr.deployed();

Basing on current provider and addresses from truffle artifact library can obtain network addresses of you deployed contracts.

## Dev Tips
When developing UI you need to deploy and use contracts locally. Here are some tips how to do it - it's not
complete "how to" but it might me useful. You should start in our ESOP repo and read and understand
at least [development](https://github.com/Neufund/ESOP#development) part.
  
* run [Parity](https://parity.io/) in dev mode - example command line ```parity ui --chain dev --jsonrpc-cors "http://localhost:8081" --jsonrpc-hosts="all" --jsonrpc-port 8444 ```
* migrate contracts (you need to install whole truffle framework) to local development chain ```cd ESOP; truffle migrate --networks paritydev```
* edit ```ESOP-ui/config.js``` and set keys to local values - we provided commented correct ones. We included proxy rule in
webpack dev server configuration so you won't have problems with CORS, SSL.
* **after** that compile and run app ```npm run dev``` - you need to restart webpack run dev after every contract deployment
* have fun
